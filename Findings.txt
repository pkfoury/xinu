Part 1 - printer.c

Each function behaves differently:
	type() - letters are printed in a seemingly random order. this function is not polled and simply sends the char to the I/O device. it misses characters.
	kerneltype() - every letter is printed in order since this is polled I/O. each letter is printed until the next is context switched in. there is no break in the order. 
	print() - prints the 50 char strings in order, ABC.
	kernelprint() - interrupts are not disabled for the entire string but only for each character. They print in order but not the same number of times.

We made the printf functions only print one string of 50 chars at a time to ensure they'd run for their time slice.
