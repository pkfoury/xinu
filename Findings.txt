## Lab 5

1) we enlarge tyebuff because otherwise we are overflowing the echo buffer when there are more than 6 characters.
	since it takes 3 characters (bksp, blank, bksp), when we have 6 or more characters, the echo buffer wraps around.
	if we do not enlarge tyebuff, the characters will remain after we type ^U.

2) we want tyebuff to be a multiple of 3. this way, there is enough room to delete all characters in the input buffer
	since it takes 3 characters to erase one from the echo buffer.
