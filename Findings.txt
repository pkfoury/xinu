These optimizations are useful because freeing blocks is very expensive.
Memory can become fragmented if memory can be allocated with arbitrary size.

A case that demonstrates the purpose of these optimization: if we need multiple blocks of the same size for a buffer.
This makes the repeated action easy to maintain.

Other optimization to improve memory allocation:
	restricting memory allocation to specific sizes and maintaining multiple free lists.
